**Status:** 🚧 *Work in progress – Open for contributions*

Corex OS is a modern Linux-based operating system focused on offering a **familiar, intuitive, and efficient** experience — perfect for both beginners and advanced users.

## 🎯 Our Goals

- **Familiar & Intuitive:** Inspired by the design principles of Windows 10, macOS, Linux Mint, and Chrome OS.
- **Terminal-Free Experience:** Thanks to the built-in **Linux Helper**, complex tasks become simple and graphical.
- **Fast & Lightweight:** Designed to run smoothly even on older or low-spec hardware.
- **Open & Adaptable:** 100% open-source, with full multi-language support at launch.

## 🧰 What is Linux Helper?

**Linux Helper** is a key application in Corex OS that allows users to perform tasks like:

- System updates  
- Git repository cloning  
- Archive extraction (.tar.gz, .tar.xz)  
- Other maintenance operations  
All through a clean and beginner-friendly graphical interface — no terminal needed.
