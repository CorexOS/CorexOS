**Project Status:** ðŸš§ **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** ðŸš§

Welcome to Corex OS â€“ a vision for an operating system that combines familiarity, intuition, and the power of AI, while eliminating technical complexity and promoting sustainability.

## Our Vision

Many users feel intimidated by the transition to Linux due to perceived barriers, especially the command line terminal. At the same time, we face a growing need to reduce electronic waste (e-waste) and revitalize older hardware. Corex OS aims to solve both problems:

* **The Most Intuitive Path to Linux:** A premium design, inspired by the best elements of Windows 10, macOS, Linux Mint, and Chrome OS, will offer a familiar and easy-to-adopt experience.
* **Terminal Elimination:** Through the innovative **"Linux Helper"** application, we will automate complex commands, transforming operations like system updates, Git repository cloning, archive extraction (tar.gz, tar.xz), and many more into simple, intuitive graphical actions.
* **The AI Era - Integrated Lyonix AI:** Corex OS will feature an advanced AI assistant, **Lyonix AI**, designed to run locally on your system, ensuring maximum privacy. Lyonix AI will be equipped with multiple AI models, accessible through a secure interface, offering intelligent contextual assistance.
    * **Dynamic Interaction:** Lyonix AI will be able to interact live with the system via a separate cursor, which pauses when the user moves the mouse, ensuring full user control.
    * **AI-Enhanced Security:** Lyonix will also function as a read-only detection antivirus system, enhancing security without modifying critical files.
    * **User Control:** Users will be able to enable/disable Lyonix AI at will from Corex OS settings, and any complex action will require user password confirmation.
    * **Design & Personalization:** Lyonix AI will offer distinct visual themes: **Light**, **Dark**, and **Neon**.

* **Sustainability and E-Waste Reduction:** By offering an ultra-lightweight version, Corex OS will be able to run smoothly even on very old hardware, contributing to extending the lifespan of these devices and reducing electronic waste. **We will demonstrate the capability of Corex OS 32-bit (Ultra-Light) by showcasing it running fluidly on a 2006 Fujitsu Siemens Lifebook laptop, equipped with an Intel Pentium M processor and 2GB of RAM!**

## Planned Versions

Corex OS will be available in 3 versions to adapt to diverse user needs:

1.  **Corex OS:** The full version, with all AI functionalities (Lyonix AI) and advanced features, optimized for modern hardware.
2.  **Corex OS Light:** An optimized version for maximum performance, without the pre-integrated AI assistant, ideal for resource-limited but 64-bit systems.
3.  **Corex OS 32-bit (Ultra-Light):** Specifically designed for very old PCs and laptops (including 32-bit architecture) and minimal resources, without AI and with a minimalist desktop environment, to provide a fluid experience and reduce e-waste.

## Technical Foundation

Corex OS will be built on a robust base of **Linux Mint Cinnamon 22.1**, featuring a powerful and customizable **KDE Plasma** desktop environment for the main versions.

## Collaboration
